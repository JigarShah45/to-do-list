## 💡 How It Works

1. Type a task in the input field.
2. Click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
3. Each task has:
   - A "Delete" button – removes the task and shows an alert.
   - An "Update" button – lets the user modify the task text.
4. All tasks are saved to localStorage and persist across page reloads.
